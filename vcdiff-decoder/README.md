# vcdiff-decoder

## Description

vcdiff-decoder is a library that provides a VCDIFF decoder implementation. VCDIFF (Delta Compression Format) is a format for encoding and decoding differences between files.

This library allows you to decode VCDIFF files and apply the differences to generate the original file.

This is pretty performant, but I didn't try for anything crazy. Mostly concerned with following the spec with clear and understandable code.
