TODO:
- Re-write encoder. There is an error in the encoding of some copy address. For now, am just encoding everything as mode 0 in the merged patch file. The error could be in the cache, but it looks correct. The assertion never triggers but I get decode errors, which mean we are feeding it incorrect data that makes it out of sync with the decode cache.
- Re-write Merger. Get rid of translator entirely? We need to work two patches at a time. I think we need to just load all instructions in to memory from earlier patch
- Early return Merger. If we are given the terminal patch and it doesn't contain any copy instructions, then merging an earlier patch would have no effect. In theory if we only merge two patches at once, then after each merge occurs, we should have an early return branch as well.
